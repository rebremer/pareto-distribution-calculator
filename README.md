# pareto-distribution-calculator
Hobby statistics Python project that does the following:
- Compute Expected value E[x], Variance Var[x] and Kurtosis Kur[x] of a fat tailed Pareto distribution
- Calculate Expected value E[x], Variance Var[x] and Kurtosis Kur[x] using Pareto distribution's calculus definitions
- Compare outcomes

Key learning in this project is as follows:

- For alpha values close to 1, extremely large tail values shall be used to compute Pareto E[x] accurately. That is, the Pareto distribution is truly fat-tailed.
